#### Core principles for UX:
* **High expectations:** Consistently well-designed channels with value-add features reflecting insights into user needs and opportunities will make Roku the preferred entertainment choice, ensuring worthwhile fun.
* **Focus on content:** The best UI is an invisible UI that enables effortless accomplishment. Users don’t want to navigate - they want to discover, browse, recommend, bookmark and consume content.
* **Platform integration (“No Silos”):** Integration with the Roku platform boosts the visibility and the usefulness of your channel. Promotions, deep linking, presence in Roku search results and more are hallmarks of a well-integrated channel that makes best use of the Roku platform’s capabilities.  Ultimately, such integration drives increased channel usage, helping more users easily find and consume your content.
