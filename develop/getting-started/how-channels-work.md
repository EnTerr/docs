# How Roku Channels Work
_Understand hosting, streaming, and building channels on the Roku Platform_

The Roku platform has thousands of channels, streaming billions of hours of content to our audience per year. As the industry leader in streaming devices and channel offerings, itâ€™s helpful to understand how a Roku channel is developed and distributed to users around the world.

**The 3 main requirements for creating a Roku Channel are:**

- Original and/or licensed video content (content publishers)
- Hosted content available through the Internet (OVP, CDN, etc.)
- Roku Channel App
  - BrightScript application for streaming video playback (developers)
  - Direct Publisher application

**Note that we do not charge developers a fee for creating channels on the Roku platform.** The best step for activating your developer account is by following the [Developer Setup Guide](/develop/getting-started/setup-guide.md).

In this post we'll cover:

- [Content hosting](#content-hosting)
- [Playing hosted videos in Roku Channels](#playing-hosted-videos-in-roku-channels)
- [Creating a Roku Channel App](#creating-a-roku-channel-app)

## Content Hosting
Before creating a channel for playing licensed content, an important first step is deciding how and where to host your videos for streaming to the Roku platform. Here are some common solutions:

**OVP (Online Video Platforms):**

- [Zype](http://www.zype.com/)
- [Wistia](http://wistia.com/)
- [Vimeo Pro](https://vimeo.com/pro)
- [Ooyala](http://www.ooyala.com/)
- [Brightcove](https://www.brightcove.com/)
- [Kaltura](http://corp.kaltura.com/)

**CDN (Content Delivery Networks):**

- [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/)
- [Scale Engine](https://www.scaleengine.com/)
- [Limelight Networks](https://www.limelight.com/)
- [EdgeCast](https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/)
- [BitGravity](http://www.bitgravity.com/)
- [thePlatform](https://www.theplatform.com/)
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Playing hosted videos in Roku Channels
Once you have your content uploaded to a hosting solution, the next step is creating and exporting what is a called a **"content feed."** That is typically an **RSS**, **XML**, or **JSON** file, containing detailed information about each video file (file format, bitrate, etc.), and the content itself (title, artwork, etc.).

The video playback flow in a Roku Channel is:

- Video is uploaded to a content hosting solution, which provides customers with a basic "feed" of all the hosted content.
- The content feed (RSS, XML, or JSON file) is added to the channel, containing the metadata for the hosted media (video, audio, etc.):
  - Title
  - Descriptions
  - Keywords/Categories
  - Artwork
  - URLs for downloading media
- Roku channels playback the content. The channel creation can be done in two different ways:
  - Using BrightScript, our scripting language, and SceneGraph, our framework for customizing the design and appearance of channels
  - With [Direct Publisher](https://developer.roku.com/publish)

## Creating a Roku Channel App
You have two options when creating a new Roku channel, depending on the level of customization you need: you can use the **Direct Publisher web app**, or develop a channel using **BrightScript**, which is Roku's **powerful scripting language**.

### Direct Publisher
Direct Publisher is Roku's new web app that allows you to **quickly create a high-quality channel without any coding**. This is a great option if you don't need a deep level of customization, or cannot allocate or outsource development work.

If you're interested in this option, head over to the [Direct Publisher Channel Tutorial](https://developer.roku.com/publish/channel-tutorial) for a quick hands-on tutorial on how to create a sample channel.

### BrightScript
BrightScript is **Roku's powerful scripting language** that lets you build channels for any Roku-powered device. This is the best option when you want **more flexibility** to fully **customize the design and UI** of your channel.

#### Finding a BrightScript developer
We encourage your development team to review the [Developer SDK Getting Started section](/develop/getting-started) and test out a basic channel building process before seeking a contractor. We have multiple guides describing in more detail how to use BrightScript such as:

- [Building a "Hello World!" Roku Channel](/develop/getting-started/hello-world.md)
- [Guides and Tutorials](/develop/guides)
- [Sample Channels](https://www.github.com/rokudev/sample-channels)
- [Roku Plugin for Eclipse](/develop/developer-tools/eclipse-plugin.md)

We also have a list of [recommended development shops that build Roku channels](https://roku.app.box.com/channel-developer-list).

For smaller contractors, here are some independent developers with reviews on Upwork:

- BrightScript: [upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/?q=brightscript](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/?q=brightscript)
- Roku Development: [upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/?q=roku](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/?q=roku)
