Roku pioneered streaming for the TV, and we aspire to power every TV in the world. As an open streaming platform, we welcome developers from around the world to grow their audience with Roku.

In addition, Roku OS is purpose-built for the TV and runs across Roku streaming players, Roku TV™ models, and Roku Powered™ players. Build, publish, and monetize your channel applications on the Roku platform.
