# Project setup

All Roku channels developed using SceneGraph must contain the following directories and a `manifest` file:

* `source` directory
* `components` directory
* `images` directory
* `manifest`

## Source Directory

The source directory contains BrightScript code for the main applicationâ€™s execution thread with the extension `.brs`. Since applications including SceneGraph scenes allow BrightScript code to either be embedded in, or used by, an XML component file in a `<script>` element, for many SceneGraph applications this directory will only contain a `main.brs` file to start the application. The `main.brs` file only need have enough BrightScript code to start the application by creating and displaying the scene specified in the SceneGraph scene.

The following shows a `main.brs` file that starts the application by creating and showing the scene defined in the SceneGraph scene named `VideoExample` (the `VideoExample` scene is defined in an XML component file in the components directory in the next section).

```brightscript
sub Main()
   screen = CreateObject("roSGScreen")
   m.port = CreateObject("roMessagePort")
   screen.setMessagePort(m.port)

   scene = screen.CreateScene("VideoExample")
   screen.show()

   # exit the channel if back button is pressed at top-level
   while(true)
       msg = wait(0, m.port)
       msgType = type(msg)
       if msgType = "roSGScreenEvent"
           if msg.isScreenClosed() then return
       end if
   end while
end sub
```

## Components Directory

The components directory contains all the XML component and associated BrightScript code files needed for your SceneGraph scene. The XML files must have the extension `.xml`, and BrightScript code files must have the extension `.brs`.

Each XML component file contains a single `<component>` element that contains a specific SceneGraph node/element tree defining that component. When the channel is launched, all the files with extension `.xml` in the `components` directory are loaded and added to the available types of nodes that can be created.

## Images Directory

Any graphic image files to be included in the application package are stored in the `images` directory. At a minimum, the `images` directory must contain the `mm_icon_focus_hd` image and a `splash_screen_FHD` graphic described in the following section.

## Manifest File

At the root level there must be a file named `manifest` which contains attributes for the application. The attributes specified in the `manifest` include the name and version number of the application, the application image to be used on the main menu, etc.

* Each attribute is on a separate line, and has the form `name=value`
* Each `name=value` pair must end with a newline character, or it may not be parsed by the firmware
* The last line must end with a newline character
* Empty lines are ignored
* Lines beginning with a '#' (number sign) are comment lines and are ignored
* The various `graphic_file_URI` field values are used to specify a graphic that allows a user to select your application and a "splash" screen that appears as the application is loading.
* All graphics files specified in the manifest file should be included in the `images` directory.
* The URI to set the path to the files should use the `pkg:` resource prefix, such as `pkg:/images/splash_sd.jpg`.

The following fields are required:

```brightscript
##  Channel Details
title=application_title
major_version=major_version_number
minor_version=minor_version_number
build_version=build_version_number

##  Main Menu Icon HD: 290x218px
mm_icon_focus_hd=HD_focus_graphic_file_URI

### FHD (1920x1080px) Splash Screen
splash_screen_fhd=FHD_splash_screen_graphic_file_URI
```
