The advantage of using Roku Search is to provide another opportunity to convert users into viewers/subscribers of your channel. It can drive referral traffic, as well as channel installations, and maximize the value of your content.

**To integrate this feature into your channel, see [Roku Search documentation](https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Roku+Search)**.
