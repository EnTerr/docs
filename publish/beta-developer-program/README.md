## Overview
The Roku Beta Developer Program provides pre-release builds of Roku OS to our developer community. Approved members are enabled to test their channels for bugs and experiment with upcoming features _before_ Roku OS is released to customers. In addition to bug reports, channel developers can submit feature requests for improving the Roku platform.

## How to participate
To be a part of the Roku Beta Developer Program, developers must first activate an account on our custom [Roku Testing Portal](https://rokutestingportal.centercode.com/callout/?callid=C3D70CF78CBB41C5906C7838A41F24BE). After registering, you’ll be asked to fill out a basic application and non-disclosure agreement. Assuming there are no conflicts of interest in your application, you will be added to the program.

Approved participants in the Roku Beta Developer Program are asked to complete their profiles by:
*   **Registering any channels they’ve built:** When filing bug reports, developers can specify which channels the issue appeared on, ensuring speedier troubleshooting and resolution.
*   **Register test devices:** All Roku devices registered through the program will automatically receive beta OS updates every time a new build is released. There is no limit to the number of devices a participant can register. Be sure to only register devices you plan on using for testing purposes.

## Feedback methods

Once registered in the program, developers can provide feedback in a variety of ways through the Roku Testing Portal:
*   **File bug reports:** Participants are asked to report all bugs they encounter during their testing. Users can "upvote" previously-reported issues to add priority to the most pervasive issues.
*   **File feature requests:** Similarly, members of the program can recommend new features or tools they’d like to see in the operating system.
*   **Open discussions:** The program provides forums to safely discuss the latest beta releases without violating the NDA.
*   **Complete surveys:** From time to time, participants will be asked to complete short surveys summarizing their experience with the OS.

## Developer Tools

In addition to pre-release OS builds, the Beta Developer Program is occasionally used to distribute diagnostic and QA automation tools to our developers. As with OS releases, participants are asked to provide feedback on these tools through the Roku Testing Portal.
