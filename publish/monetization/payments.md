# Payments

_Revenue shares, disbursements, tax forms, and more for channels_

### Overview

A primary goal for the Roku publishing platform is sharing revenue with our channel developers. With the majority of our customers having up to date payment details, there is a major opportunity for publishers to monetize their audience.
